## General Architecture


## Challenges

**Prizes**

Each category will have two prizes: $700 USDC, $300 USDC

**​​Innovators:**

INTU introduces dynamic private keyshares for all developers, regardless of background or experience. The “Innovators” prize is for projects who use this new framework to build a new product, service, protocol, or infrastructure. The sky is limit with what’s possible, now that Web3 accounts have changeable “passwords”!

These projects are intended to be used by other builders to improve their own end-user experience.

Examples include:

-   PAYMASTER or Proxy Payment Systems, including micro transactions   
-   One-click On-boarding Infrastructure, Social Log-in, WebAuthN, PassKeys, etc    
-   Conditions-based Access Control    
-   INTU Keyshare Assignment to non-EOA factors    
-   INTU on non-blockchain channels of communication
-   INTU + Digital ID, including on-chain credentials, off-chain credentials, and ZKP-based Conditional verification

Current projects building on INTU we would consider innovative applications: [Manda](https://medium.com/@intuofficial/revolutionizing-otc-desks-with-mandadao-and-intus-sdk-pioneering-a-fair-and-secure-future-for-f929ec443fb7), [Kagami](https://medium.com/@intuofficial/a-new-era-of-self-custody-how-kagami-and-intu-are-revolutionizing-digital-asset-management-d0cad7c248d0)

*Acceptance Criteria*

Projects are eligible for submission if they can demonstrate that their innovation is useful, technically feasible, and integrates with common frameworks. They are not required to have a front-end, or be usable by an end-user. Bonus points if the project is able to demonstrate the innovative protocol, service, or infrastructure live, either in a simple front-end or in terminal.

INTU reserves the right to determine eligibility.

Submissions earning other INTU bounties are not eligible for the prize pool.

**Infrastructure:**

This prize is intended for projects that are applying INTU’s SDK for other (non end-user) infrastructure providers in the Web3 space. Examples include:

-   Proof of Stake Validator Networks, or Distributed Solo-staker Clients
-   Liquid Staking Providers
-   Relayers
-   Cross-chain Infrastructure providers, such as guardians
-   Enterprise or Organization Shared Treasuries
-   DAO Frameworks

Essentially, any environment where infrastructure would benefit from sharing keyshares from a single account rather than coordinate several individual EOAs with a consensus mechanism.

*Acceptance Criteria*

A successful integration to qualify for the prize pool will be defined as creating and/or using INTU accounts for infrastructure applications. INTU reserves the right to determine eligibility.

Submissions earning other INTU bounties are not eligible for the prize pool.

**Interfaces:**

This prize is offered for any dapp, wallet, client, or mobile app that uses INTU’s SDK to create accounts for their end-users. This can include:

-   DAO interfaces
-   Web3 Games
-   Metaverse Interfaces
-   Wallets, including Smart Contract, browser, mobile, and in-app key management solutions
-   NFT-focused Interfaces
-   DeFi-focused dashboards, aggregators, or tooling
 
These interfaces can make use of INTU’s dynamic private keyshares for a variety of purposes, including flexible ownership, account recovery, proactive security, account transfer, or custom onboarding/offboarding.

*Acceptance Criteria*

A successful integration to qualify for the prize will be defined as allowing users to create INTU accounts within an application, using a custom, or purpose-specific interface. INTU reserves the right to determine eligibility.

Submissions earning other INTU bounties are not eligible for the prize pool.
