## Challenges

### **Prizes**

Each category will have one prize: $500 USDC.

### **Analysis üèÜ**

The "Analysis‚Äù prize is designed for innovative projects who are able to build a new product, service or tool capable of automatically analyzing smart contracts and detect vulnerabilities.

This challenge aims to address the critical need for advanced techniques and solutions to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts. 


*Acceptance Criteria*

To be eligible for the "Analysis" prize, your project should demonstrate a deep understanding of smart contract vulnerabilities and propose an innovative method for identifying and analyzing them. The automated analysis should cover a broad range of potential vulnerabilities.

Successful projects in this category should also consider factors like accuracy, efficiency, scalability, and user-friendliness in their solutions. The ability to handle various programming languages commonly used for smart contracts, such as Solidity, Vyper, or Michelson, will be advantageous. 

Bonus if you are integrating machine learning, static analysis, or other advanced techniques to enhance the analysis capabilities.

Nefture reserves the right to determine eligibility.

Submissions earning other Nefture bounties are not eligible for the prize pool.

### **Optimize üèÜ**

The "Optimize" challenge is specifically tailored for projects that can find creative ways to optimize gas fees for transactions on the blockchain. 

This challenge seeks to address the pressing need for novel approaches, algorithms, or tools that can effectively reduce gas fees while maintaining transaction efficiency and security. Participants are encouraged to explore creative ways to optimize gas consumption, minimize unnecessary computation, and enhance the overall cost-effectiveness of blockchain operations.

*Acceptance Criteria*

To be eligible for the "Optimize" prize, your project should demonstrate a deep understanding of gas fees and propose practical methods to mitigate their impact. Participants are encouraged to explore various strategies and supports.

Successful projects in this category should consider factors such as scalability, compatibility with existing blockchain platforms, and user experience. It is essential to ensure that the proposed optimization techniques do not compromise the security or correctness of transactions and smart contracts.
